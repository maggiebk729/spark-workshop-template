# Give Your Org a Spark ✒️⚡

> Build a Chief Agentic Officer — a multi-agent AI system that runs your organization's operations.

**155,000 lines of code. 17 projects. 1 founder. 0 funding. 8 AI agents. $20/month.**

Spark is the operating system behind [Radical Imagination](https://radicalimagination.xyz), a cultural heritage technology collective. It manages grants, curricula, cultural validation, impact reporting, outreach, and portfolio tracking — all through a multi-agent architecture running on Claude Code.

This repo is the template. Fork it. Customize it. Give your org a Spark.

## What Spark Does (at Radical Imagination)

| Agent | What It Does | What It Replaces |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Curriculum Architect** | Designs learning experiences | Instructional designer ($65-85K) |
| **Money Agent** | Grant strategy, funder analysis | Grant writer ($50-70K) |
| **Cultural Archivist** | Source registries, provenance | Research archivist ($55-75K) |
| **Cultural Validator** | Reviews for cultural integrity | Cultural consultant ($100-250/hr) |
| **Technical Mentor** | Code guidance, learning paths | Senior dev mentor |
| **Collective Manager** | Roster, portfolio, onboarding | Operations manager |
| **Impact & Engagement** | Reports, social, content | Impact analyst ($30-40K) |
| **Commercial Strategist** | Evaluates opportunities | Business dev |

**Total replaced labor: ~$250K/year. Cost: $20/month (Claude Code subscription).**

## How It Works

1. **You talk to Spark.** One entry point, not 8 separate tools.
2. **Spark routes to the right agent** based on what you're asking.
3. **Every agent reads the same state files** — your portfolio, priorities, people, decisions.
4. **Every agent writes to the same state files** — the institution documents itself.
5. **Memory persists across sessions** — Spark remembers your preferences, your corrections, your context.
6. **Every session starts and ends with a protocol** — read state, check for contradictions, do the work, update state, draft the morning email.

The state files ARE the institution. If the founder gets hit by a bus, the state files tell the next person everything.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) subscription (~$20/month)
- A text editor (VS Code, Cursor, or any)
- A Gmail account (for email drafting via MCP)
- A project or organization you want to build Spark for

### Setup (15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Fork this repo
gh repo fork radical-imagination/spark-workshop-template --clone

# 2. Open in your editor
cd spark-workshop-template
code .

# 3. Customize CLAUDE.md with your org's name and instructions
# 4. Fill in state/org-state.md with your real projects and priorities
# 5. Design your agents in agents/ (start with 3, expand to 5-8)
# 6. Add 3-5 initial memories to memory/

# 7. Start Claude Code and load your project
claude

# 8. Your first prompt:
# "Read CLAUDE.md and the state files. What's the status of my projects?"
```

### Your First Session

Ask Spark:
- "What's the status of my projects?"
- "Draft a grant strategy for [funder]"
- "Review this [document] for [criteria]"
- "Draft an email to [person] about [topic]"
- "What decisions have we made this month?"
- "What's stale? What needs attention?"

## Key Principles

1. **8 agents max.** Google research shows multi-agent systems lose performance above 8. Make each one smarter, not more numerous.
2. **State files ARE the institution.** If the AI forgets everything between sessions, it's a stranger you brief every morning.
3. **Drafts only, never sends.** The AI drafts emails. The human reviews and sends. Tone is personal. Relationships are human.
4. **The protocol is the discipline.** Every session starts the same (read state, check contradictions) and ends the same (update state, draft morning email).
5. **Memory is earned.** The AI remembers corrections, preferences, and context across sessions. It gets better the more you use it.
